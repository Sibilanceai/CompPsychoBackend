# ## 1. **Data Collection Setup**
#    - **EEG Data**: Use Neurosity's Python API to collect EEG data from participants while they watch a video, TV show, or read a book. Ensure that the EEG device is correctly calibrated and the data is accurately timestamped.
#    - **Content Timestamping**: Simultaneously record timestamps for each scene or chapter in the video, TV show, or book. This will require a method to either manually or automatically log these times.

# ## 2. **Narrative Deconstruction**
#    - **Event Representation**: Convert the narrative content into a structured format that represents significant events or milestones within the narrative. Each event should have a timestamp and a brief description.
#    - **Semantic Analysis**: Utilize natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze the text or dialogue for emotional cues or significant narrative shifts.

# ## 3. **EEG Analysis**
#    - **Preprocessing**: Filter and clean the EEG data to remove noise and artifacts.
#    - **Feature Extraction**: Identify features relevant to attention and emotion, such as power spectral densities in different EEG bands or event-related potentials.

# ## 4. **Data Integration and Analysis**
#    - **Time Delay Embeddings**: Use time delay embeddings to capture the temporal dynamics between the narrative events and the EEG signals.
#    - **Correlation Analysis**: Analyze how changes in the EEG data correlate with narrative events. This could involve statistical tests or machine learning models to predict emotional states based on EEG features aligned with narrative events.

# ## 5. **Attention Weighting**
#    - **Modeling Attention**: Incorporate metrics from the EEG that signify attention to weight the significance of different narrative events in predicting emotional outcomes.
#    - **Attention Analysis**: Use attention analysis to determine which parts of the content are most engaging or emotionally provocative.

# ## 6. **Predictive Modeling**
#    - **Machine Learning Models**: Train models to predict emotional responses based on the time series of event embeddings and EEG data. Consider using models that can handle sequential data, like LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks.
#    - **Validation**: Validate the model with new data and assess its accuracy in predicting emotional states and engagement levels.

# ## 7. **System Integration**
#    - **Real-Time Processing**: If you intend the system to work in real-time, ensure that the data processing and analysis pipelines are optimized for low latency.
#    - **User Interface**: Develop a user-friendly interface for experimenters and participants to interact with the system, view results, and possibly adjust parameters in real-time.

# To help you get started with your project, here's a high-level code implementation outline. This outline includes key components and suggests Python libraries you might use:

### 1. **Setup and Configuration**
#    - Import necessary libraries (e.g., `mne` for EEG data processing, `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib` for data manipulation and visualization).
#    - Configure Neurosity API and other tools for data collection and processing.

import mne
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from neurosity import NeurosityAPI  # Assuming a placeholder library name

neurosity_api = NeurosityAPI(device_id="your_device_id")


### 2. **Data Collection**
#    - Initialize and calibrate the Neurosity device.
#    - Start data collection synchronized with content playback.
#    - Log events and timestamps from the narrative content.


def collect_eeg_data():
    neurosity_api.start_recording()
    # Implement event logging logic here

def log_event(event_description, timestamp):
    # Logging event with its timestamp
    pass

# Example usage
collect_eeg_data()


### 3. **EEG Data Processing**
#    - Load the collected EEG data.
#    - Preprocess data (filtering, artifact removal).


def preprocess_eeg_data(raw_data):
    # Filtering and artifact removal
    filtered_data = mne.filter.filter_data(raw_data, l_freq=1.0, h_freq=40.0)
    return filtered_data


### 4. **Narrative Analysis**
#    - Parse narrative data into structured event timestamps.
#    - Analyze narrative for emotional content using NLP.


from nltk.sentiment import SentimentIntensityAnalyzer

def parse_narrative(content):
    # Parse narrative content into structured data
    pass

def analyze_emotion(text):
    sia = SentimentIntensityAnalyzer()
    sentiment_scores = sia.polarity_scores(text)
    return sentiment_scores


### 5. **Feature Extraction and Time Series Analysis**
#    - Extract EEG features relevant to attention and emotion.
#    - Create time series representations for EEG and narrative events.


def extract_features(eeg_data):
    # Extract relevant EEG features
    pass

def create_time_series(eeg_features, event_data):
    # Combine EEG and narrative events into a time series dataset
    pass


### 6. **Model Training and Prediction**
#    - Train models to predict emotional responses.
#    - Validate and test the models.


from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier

def train_model(X_train, y_train):
    model = RandomForestClassifier()
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)
    return model

def predict_emotion(model, X_test):
    predictions = model.predict(X_test)
    return predictions


### 7. **Integration and Visualization**
#    - Integrate all components into a cohesive system.
#    - Implement real-time visualization or logging of results.


def main():
    # Main logic to orchestrate data collection, processing, and prediction
    raw_data = neurosity_api.get_data()
    preprocessed_data = preprocess_eeg_data(raw_data)
    eeg_features = extract_features(preprocessed_data)
    # Similar steps for narrative data and model training
    pass

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()


# ### 8. **Ethical and Privacy Handling**
#    - Implement data handling protocols to ensure privacy and consent.


def handle_data_privacy(data):
    # Implement data privacy measures
    pass
